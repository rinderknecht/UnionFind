    (* Each equivalence class is implemented by a Catalan tree linked
       upwardly and otherwise is a link to another node. Those trees
       are height-balanced. The type [node] implements nodes in those
       trees.

         The value of [Root h] denotes the root of a tree, that is, the
       representative of the associated class.  The height [h] is that
       of the tree, so a tree reduced to its root alone has height 0.

         If not a root, a node is a link to another node. Because the
       links are upward, that is, bottom-up, and we seek a purely
       functional implementation, we need to uncouple the nodes and
       the items here, so the first component of [Link] is an item,
       not a node. That is why the type [node] is not recursive, and
       called [node], not [tree]: to become a traversable tree, it
       needs to be complemented by the type [partition] below to
       associate items back to nodes. In order to follow a path upward
       in the tree until the root, we start from a link node giving us
       the next item, then find the node corresponding to the item
       thanks to [partition], and again until we arrive at the root.

         The height component is that of the source of the link, that
       is, [h] is the height of the node linking to the node [Link
       (j,h)], _not_ of [j], except when [equal i j]. *)

    (* The call [alias i j p] results in the same partition as [equiv
       i j p], except that [i] is not the representative of its class
       in [alias i j p] (whilst it may be in [equiv i j p]).

       This property is irrespective of the heights of the
       representatives of [i] and [j], that is, of the trees
       implementing their classes. If [i] is not a representative of
       its class before calling [alias], then the height criterium is
       applied (which, without the constraint above, would yield a
       new height-balanced tree). *)
